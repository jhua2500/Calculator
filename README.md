# Calculator
calculator with basic math and graphing capabilities

everything you would see in a ti-84 graphing calculator, with a few funcionalities missing
need to add square root, parentheses... (anything else?)
graphing works with almost any kind of equation, with the exception of conics and polynomial division (no parentheses function yet)
another problem with graphing: can't graph 3 equations at once, which is the ultimate goal (graphing equation2 erases equation1)
